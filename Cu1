Yes, I can help you create a Bash script using `curl` to check for new webpages published to a website in the last 1 day. Here's an example script that you can modify to suit your needs:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Set the URL of the website you want to check
URL="https://example.com"

# Set the time range for the check (in seconds)
TIME_RANGE=86400 # 1 day

# Get the current date and time in Unix timestamp format
CURRENT_TIME=$(date +%s)

# Calculate the start time for the check
START_TIME=$((CURRENT_TIME - TIME_RANGE))

# Use curl to get a list of all the pages on the website
# and filter the output to include only pages that were modified
# after the start time of the check
PAGE_LIST=$(curl -s -L "$URL" | grep -o '<a href=['"'"'"][^"'"'"']*['"'"'"]' | sed -e 's/^<a href=["'"'"']//' -e 's/["'"'"']$//' | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq | while read PAGE; do DATE=$(curl -s -L -I "$URL/$PAGE" | grep -i 'Last-Modified:' | awk '{print $3" "$4" "$5" "$6" "$7" "$8}'); if [ -n "$DATE" ]; then PAGE_TIME=$(date --date="$DATE" +%s); if [ "$PAGE_TIME" -ge "$START_TIME" ]; then echo "$PAGE"; fi; fi; done)

# Display the list of pages that were modified in the last 1 day
echo "Pages modified in the last 1 day:"
echo "$PAGE_LIST"
```

This script uses `curl` to retrieve the contents of the website and then uses a combination of `grep`, `sed`, and `awk` to extract the list of pages on the website. It then loops through the list of pages and uses `curl` again to retrieve the `Last-Modified` header for each page. If the `Last-Modified` date is within the specified time range, the script adds the page to a list of modified pages. Finally, the script displays the list of pages that were modified in the last 1 day.

You can modify the `URL` and `TIME_RANGE` variables at the top of the script to suit your needs. Note that the `TIME_RANGE` variable is set in seconds, so you can adjust it to check for a different time range if needed.
