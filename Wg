To check for new web pages published on a website in the last day, you can use the `wget` command to download the website's sitemap and then parse it to look for pages that have been modified within the last 24 hours. Here's an example Bash script:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Set the URL of the website's sitemap
SITEMAP_URL="https://example.com/sitemap.xml"

# Set the maximum age of pages to consider (in seconds)
MAX_AGE=$((24*60*60))

# Download the sitemap and extract the URLs of pages modified within the last day
URLS=$(wget -qO- "$SITEMAP_URL" | grep -Eo '<loc>([^<]+)</loc>' | sed -e 's#<loc>##g' -e 's#</loc>##g' | xargs wget --spider -S 2>&1 | grep 'Last-Modified' | sed -e 's/Last-Modified: //g' -e 's/ GMT//g' -e 's/ /T/g' -e 's/\r//g' | date +%s -f - +'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S' | awk -v max_age="$MAX_AGE" '$1 >= (systime() - max_age)' | cut -d' ' -f2)

# Print the list of URLs
echo "New pages published in the last day:"
echo "$URLS"
```

Here's a brief explanation of what the script does:

1. Set the URL of the website's sitemap and the maximum age of pages to consider (in seconds).
2. Download the sitemap using `wget`, extract the URLs of pages from the sitemap, and use `xargs` to send each URL to `wget --spider` to check the headers of the page.
3. Use `grep` and `sed` to extract the `Last-Modified` header from the headers output by `wget --spider`, convert the date format to seconds since the Unix epoch using `date`, and use `awk` to filter out URLs whose `Last-Modified` date is older than the maximum age.
4. Use `cut` to extract the URLs of pages that have been modified within the last day.
5. Print the list of new pages published in the last day.

Note that this script assumes that the website has a sitemap that lists all of its pages, and that the sitemap is publicly accessible. If the website doesn't have a sitemap or the sitemap is not publicly accessible, you may need to modify the script to crawl the website's pages directly. Additionally, this script may not work correctly if the website uses caching or CDN services that interfere with the `Last-Modified` header.
